# Content Revenue Intelligence Prompt Library

**50+ AI prompts to extract insights, automate growth, and turn your content into revenue**

This repository contains a comprehensive library of AI-ready prompts built for solopreneurs, newsletter creators, consultants, and small teams who want to extract more value from the content they already produce. Each prompt helps you identify revenue opportunities, automate repetitive tasks, or refine your messaging so your content works harder for your business.
