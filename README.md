Content Revenue Intelligence Prompt Library
50+ AI prompts to extract insights, automate growth and turn your content into revenue

This repository contains a comprehensive library of AI‐ready prompts built for solopreneurs, newsletter creators, consultants and small teams who want to extract more value from the content they already produce. Each prompt helps you identify revenue opportunities, automate repetitive tasks or refine your messaging so that your content works harder for your business.

Library overview
The library is organised into six categories. Each category is a directory within the prompts folder containing Markdown files with ready‑to‑use prompts, a description of their purpose and a list of inputs you need to gather before using them.

Category	Number of prompts	Purpose
Content Intelligence & Repurposing	10	Extract maximum value from existing content
Client & Call Transcript Analysis	10	Mine insights from customer interactions
Automation & Workflow Design	10	Design and implement repeatable processes
Copy, Messaging & Positioning	10	Refine language to improve conversions
Offers, Products & Sales Strategy	10	Build and price products and offers
Insight Generation & Feedback Loops	5	Gather and analyse audience feedback

Revenue potential: When used systematically these prompts can help generate significant income from assets you already own, as described in the detailed overview page. See prompt-library-overview.md for a full listing of all prompts and their strategic use cases.

Getting started
Browse the categories: Navigate to the prompts directory and select the area that matches your goal. Each Markdown file includes a clear description, required inputs and a copy‑ready prompt.

Start with the strategic prioritizer: If you’re unsure which prompts to use, begin with the Strategic Business Prioritizer (prompts/prioritize-prompt.md). This assessment recommends a small set of high‑ROI prompts tailored to your situation.

Gather inputs: For best results collect the information listed under Inputs Required in each prompt file. This might include analytics exports, call transcripts or content titles.

Copy the prompt: Each file contains a pre‑formatted prompt between code fences. Copy it into your preferred AI tool and fill in your data where indicated.

Fork the repository and create a feature branch.

Add your prompt file under the appropriate category with a clear title, purpose, inputs list and code‑fenced prompt. Keep descriptions concise and actionable.
