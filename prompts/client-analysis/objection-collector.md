# Objection Collector

## Purpose
Systematically identify and categorize customer objections, concerns, and hesitations from conversations to build comprehensive objection-handling frameworks and improve sales processes.

## When To Use
- Analyzing sales calls where prospects didn't move forward
- Reviewing customer feedback about hesitations or concerns
- Preparing sales teams with common objection responses
- Creating FAQ sections that address real concerns
- Developing marketing content that preemptively handles objections

## Prompt Template

```
Extract all objections and concerns from this customer conversation:

**PROSPECT/CUSTOMER**: [Name, role, company, context]
**CONVERSATION TYPE**: [Sales call, demo, consultation, etc.]
**OFFER/SOLUTION DISCUSSED**: [What was being proposed]
**OUTCOME**: [Did they move forward, decline, or delay?]

Categorize objections using this framework:

## PRICE OBJECTIONS
- **Sticker Shock**: [Reactions to total price]
- **Budget Constraints**: [Stated financial limitations]
- **ROI Concerns**: [Doubts about return on investment]
- **Timing Issues**: [Wrong time financially]
- **Value Questions**: [Not seeing enough value for price]

## TRUST/CREDIBILITY OBJECTIONS
- **Provider Doubts**: [Concerns about you/your company]
- **Solution Skepticism**: [Doubts the solution will work]
- **Risk Aversion**: [Fear of making wrong decision]
- **Past Bad Experiences**: [Previous vendor disappointments]
- **Proof Requirements**: [Need more evidence/testimonials]

## PRIORITY/URGENCY OBJECTIONS
- **Not Urgent**: [Problem isn't pressing enough]
- **Other Priorities**: [More important things to focus on]
- **Timing Concerns**: [Wrong time to start]
- **Bandwidth Issues**: [Too busy to implement]

## AUTHORITY/PROCESS OBJECTIONS
- **Decision Maker Absent**: [Need others involved]
- **Internal Process**: [Must follow company procedures]
- **Committee Decisions**: [Group decision required]
- **Approval Needed**: [Someone else must sign off]

## SOLUTION FIT OBJECTIONS
- **Feature Gaps**: [Missing needed functionality]
- **Complexity Concerns**: [Too complicated to implement]
- **Integration Worries**: [Won't work with current systems]
- **Customization Needs**: [Requires too much modification]

For each objection, document:
- **Exact Words Used**: [Their specific language]
- **Underlying Concern**: [The real fear behind the objection]
- **Strength Level**: [How firm the objection was, 1-10]
- **Response Given**: [How you handled it in the moment]
- **Resolution Status**: [Resolved, partially addressed, unresolved]
- **Follow-up Needed**: [What additional proof or information might help]
```

## Input Requirements
- Detailed conversation notes or call recording
- Context about the prospect and their situation
- Information about what solution was presented
- Any supporting materials or demos shown
- Follow-up communications if available

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive categorized list of all objections raised
- Analysis of underlying concerns behind each objection
- Assessment of objection strength and resolution status
- Identification of patterns across multiple conversations
- Recommendations for future objection handling

## Usage Tips
- Look for objections that weren't directly stated but implied
- Pay attention to tone and hesitation as much as words
- Note which objections came up multiple times
- Distinguish between genuine concerns and stalling tactics
- Track which responses work best for each objection type
- Build responses that address underlying fears, not just surface objections

## Strategic Value
- Improves sales conversion rates through better objection handling
- Identifies product or service improvements needed
- Creates content that preemptively addresses common concerns
- Builds more effective sales training and scripts
- Reduces sales cycle length by handling objections proactively
- Develops pricing and positioning strategies that minimize objections

## Example Applications
- Sales training materials with real objection scenarios
- FAQ sections that address actual customer concerns
- Website copy that preemptively handles common objections
- Email sequences that gradually address hesitations
- Sales scripts with proven objection responses
- Product positioning that minimizes common concerns
