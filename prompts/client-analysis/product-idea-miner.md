## Prompt Template

```
Mine product opportunities from this customer conversation:

**EXISTING SOLUTIONS THEY USE**: [Your products + competitor products]

Extract product opportunities in these categories:

## DIRECT REQUESTS
- **Explicit Asks**: [Features or products they directly requested]
- **Wish List Items**: ["I wish I could..." or "It would be great if..."]
- **Feature Gaps**: [Specific functionality missing from current solutions]

## WORKFLOW GAPS
- **Manual Processes**: [Things they do manually that could be automated]
- **Tool Switching**: [Multiple tools used for single workflow]
- **Workarounds**: [Creative solutions they've built for missing features]
- **Integration Needs**: [Systems that need to connect but don't]

## ADJACENT OPPORTUNITIES
- **Related Services**: [Complementary services they purchase elsewhere]
- **Upstream/Downstream Needs**: [Before/after your solution in their process]
- **Industry-Specific Requirements**: [Unique needs for their sector]
- **Scale/Growth Needs**: [Solutions needed as they grow]

## FRUSTRATION-BASED IDEAS
- **Current Tool Complaints**: [What they hate about existing solutions]
- **Process Inefficiencies**: [Things that take too long or cost too much]
- **Error-Prone Areas**: [Where mistakes commonly happen]
- **Training/Support Gaps**: [Where they need more help]

For each opportunity, analyze:
- **Market Size Indicator**: [How many customers might need this]
- **Urgency Level**: [How quickly they need a solution, 1-10]
- **Willingness to Pay**: [Budget indicators or price sensitivity]
- **Competition Assessment**: [Existing solutions in this space]
- **Development Complexity**: [How hard this would be to build, 1-10]
- **Revenue Potential**: [Estimated revenue opportunity]
- **Customer Language**: [Exact words they used to describe the need]
