# Why This Matters Block

## Purpose
Create compelling "why this matters" sections that reinforce value, address skepticism, and motivate action by connecting features to meaningful outcomes.

## When To Use
- Prospects understand what you do but not why they should care
- Need to justify higher prices or premium positioning
- Want to address "so what?" objections preemptively
- Creating urgency without using false scarcity
- Building value in sales presentations or proposals

## Prompt Template

```
Create a "Why This Matters" section for this offer/product:

**WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING**: [Product/service description]
**TARGET AUDIENCE**: [Who this is for]
**MAIN FEATURES/BENEFITS**: [Key selling points]
**COMPETITIVE CONTEXT**: [What alternatives exist]

Write a compelling "Why This Matters" block that addresses:

**THE BIGGER PICTURE**:
- Why is this problem important to solve now?
- What happens if they don't address this?
- How does this connect to their larger goals?

**THE COST OF INACTION**:
- What are they losing by waiting?
- What opportunities are they missing?
- How does the status quo hold them back?

**THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT**:
- How does solving this create additional benefits?
- What other areas of their life/business improve?
- What becomes possible that wasn't before?

**THE UNIQUENESS FACTOR**:
- Why is your approach different/better?
- What can't they get elsewhere?
- Why is this the right time for this solution?

Structure as a 3-4 paragraph block that:
- Starts with validation of their situation
- Builds urgency through consequence
- Shows the ripple effects of solving this
- Ends with why your approach is uniquely positioned

Tone: Authoritative but not pushy, urgent but not panicky.
```
