# Value-First Product Rewrite

## Purpose
Transform feature-heavy product descriptions into benefit-driven copy that immediately communicates value and impact to potential customers.

## When To Use
- Your product descriptions list features but don't sell outcomes
- Prospects don't understand why they should care about your features
- Conversion rates are low despite good traffic
- Need to communicate value more clearly and quickly

## Prompt Template

```
Rewrite this product description to lead with value instead of features:

[PASTE CURRENT DESCRIPTION HERE]

Target audience: [DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMER]

Follow this structure:

**HEADLINE**: Lead with the #1 outcome they want
**SUBHEAD**: Clarify who this is for and why it matters now
**BENEFIT BLOCKS**: Convert each feature into a "so what" benefit

For each feature mentioned, rewrite using this format:
- Feature: [What it is]
- Benefit: [What it does for them]
- Impact: [How their life/business changes]

**SOCIAL PROOF**: Add credibility with numbers, testimonials, or authority
**URGENCY**: Why they should act now (without being pushy)
**CTA**: Clear next step that reduces friction

Guidelines:
- Start every sentence with a benefit, not a feature
- Use "you" language throughout
- Include specific outcomes and timeframes
- Address their biggest fear or frustration
- Make the value immediately obvious
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max
```

## Inputs Required

### Original Content for Optimization
