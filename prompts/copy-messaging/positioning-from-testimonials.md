# Positioning From Testimonials

## Purpose
Transform raw customer testimonials and feedback into compelling product positioning that highlights your most powerful value propositions.

## When To Use
- You have genuine customer testimonials but struggle to articulate positioning
- Current product descriptions feel generic or feature-heavy
- Need to identify which benefits actually matter to customers
- Want to create positioning that sounds authentic, not manufactured

## Prompt Template

```
I have these real customer testimonials and feedback:

[PASTE TESTIMONIALS HERE]

Extract the strongest positioning angles from this feedback and write 3 different product pitch variations:

1. **Primary Positioning**: What's the #1 benefit customers actually care about? Write a 2-sentence pitch focused on this.

2. **Secondary Positioning**: What's the unexpected benefit they mention? Write a pitch that leads with this unique angle.

3. **Emotional Positioning**: What feeling or transformation do they describe? Write a pitch that captures this emotional outcome.

For each pitch, include:
- Hook (attention-grabbing opener)
- Core benefit (what they actually get)
- Proof point (credibility from the testimonials)
- Call to action

Guidelines:
- Use their actual language and phrases where possible
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Highlight what makes you different based on their words
- Keep each pitch under 100 words
