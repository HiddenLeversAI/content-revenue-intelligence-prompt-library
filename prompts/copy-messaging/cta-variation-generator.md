# CTA Variation Generator

## Purpose
Generate call-to-action variations tailored to different voice tones, customer journey stages, and psychological triggers to maximize conversion and engagement.

## When To Use
- Current CTAs aren't converting well
- Need different CTAs for different audience segments
- Want to test various psychological approaches
- Creating CTAs for different funnel stages
- Matching CTA tone to brand voice and customer readiness

## Prompt Template

```
Generate CTA variations for this offer:

**OFFER**: [What they're signing up for/buying]
**TARGET AUDIENCE**: [Who this is for]
**CURRENT CTA**: [What you're using now, if any]
**CONTEXT**: [Where this CTA appears - email, landing page, social, etc.]
**CUSTOMER STAGE**: [Awareness level - cold, warm, hot prospects]

Create 10 CTA variations using these approaches:

1. **Direct/Urgent**: Straightforward command with urgency
2. **Benefit-Forward**: Leads with what they get
3. **Low-Pressure**: Reduces friction and commitment fear
4. **Curiosity-Driven**: Creates intrigue about what happens next
5. **Social Proof**: Leverages what others are doing
6. **Problem-Solution**: Addresses their pain point directly
7. **Identity-Based**: Appeals to who they want to become
8. **Time-Sensitive**: Creates legitimate urgency
9. **Value-Focused**: Emphasizes the outcome or transformation
10. **Action-Oriented**: Uses power verbs and momentum language

For each CTA variation, include:
- The psychological trigger being used
- Best use case scenario
- Customer readiness level it works best for
- Any A/B testing notes

Guidelines:
- Keep CTAs between 2-7 words when possible
- Use action verbs that match your audience's energy

- Avoid generic phrases like "Click Here" or "Submit"
