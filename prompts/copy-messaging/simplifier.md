# Simplifier

## Purpose
Distill complex value propositions, product descriptions, and messaging down to the essential elements that matter most to your customers.

## When To Use
- Your current messaging is too complex or confusing
- Prospects don't understand what you do quickly enough
- Need elevator pitch versions of longer descriptions
- Creating social media bios or taglines
- Simplifying technical products for broader audiences

## Prompt Template

```
Simplify this messaging to its absolute essentials:

[PASTE COMPLEX MESSAGING HERE]

**TARGET AUDIENCE**: [Who needs to understand this]
**CONTEXT**: [Where this simplified version will be used]
**KEY CONSTRAINT**: [Word limit, character limit, or other restrictions]

Create these simplified versions:

**ONE SENTENCE**: The absolute core of what you do and why it matters
**THREE WORDS**: The essence of your value proposition
**ELEVATOR PITCH**: 30-second explanation for networking situations
**TAGLINE**: Memorable phrase that captures your positioning

For each version, focus on:
1. **WHO** you help (be specific)
2. **WHAT** outcome you deliver (be concrete)
3. **HOW** you're different (unique mechanism or approach)

Simplification Rules:
- Remove industry jargon unless your audience uses it daily
- Cut features, keep only the most important benefits
- Use common words over complex ones
- Focus on one primary benefit instead of multiple
- Make it conversation-friendly
- Ensure a 12-year-old could understand it
- Test if someone can repeat it back accurately

Ask yourself: "If I had 10 seconds to explain this, what would I say?"
```

## Input Requirements
