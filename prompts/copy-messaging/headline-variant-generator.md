# Headline Variant Generator

## Purpose
Generate multiple headline and hook variations that test different psychological triggers, benefits, and angles to maximize engagement and conversions.

## When To Use
- Need fresh angles for the same offer or content
- Current headlines aren't performing well
- Want to test different psychological approaches
- Creating multiple ads or social posts for the same content
- Need hooks for different stages of the customer journey

## Prompt Template

```
Create 10 headline variations for this offer/content:

**CORE OFFER**: [Describe what you're promoting]
**TARGET AUDIENCE**: [Who this is for]
**MAIN BENEFIT**: [Primary outcome they want]
**CONTEXT**: [Where these headlines will be used - email, social, ads, etc.]

Generate headlines using these psychological triggers:

1. **Curiosity Gap**: Create intrigue without giving away the answer
2. **Urgency**: Time-sensitive or scarcity-based appeal
3. **Social Proof**: Leverage others' success or popularity
4. **Problem/Solution**: Address pain point + promise resolution
5. **Benefit Forward**: Lead with the outcome they want
6. **Controversy**: Challenge common beliefs or practices
7. **Question Hook**: Engage with a compelling question
8. **Numbers/Specificity**: Use specific metrics or timeframes
9. **Transformation**: Before and after states
10. **Authority**: Leverage expertise or credentials

For each headline, include:
- The psychological trigger used
- Why this angle would work for your audience
- Suggested use case (email subject, social post, ad, etc.)

Keep headlines between 5-12 words when possible.
Make each variation feel distinct and testable.
