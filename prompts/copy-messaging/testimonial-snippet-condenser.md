Create these variations for each testimonial:

**MICRO (15-25 words)**: Perfect for social media graphics or button hover text
**SHORT (30-50 words)**: Ideal for landing page testimonial sections
**MEDIUM (60-90 words)**: Good for case study previews or email signatures

For each condensed version:
- Preserve the most powerful language and specific outcomes
- Keep the customer's authentic voice
- Include the most credible details (numbers, timeframes, specifics)
- Maintain emotional impact
- Ensure it stands alone without context

**SNIPPET FOCUS OPTIONS**:
1. **Outcome-focused**: Highlight the result they achieved
2. **Process-focused**: Emphasize how easy/smooth the experience was
3. **Emotional-focused**: Capture the feeling or transformation
4. **Comparison-focused**: Show how you're better than alternatives
5. **Specific-focused**: Lead with numbers, timeframes, or metrics

Include customer name and relevant title/context for credibility.
Mark which parts are direct quotes vs. paraphrased.
