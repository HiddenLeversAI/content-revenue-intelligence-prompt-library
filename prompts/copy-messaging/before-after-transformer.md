# Before & After Transformer

## Purpose
Create compelling before-and-after transformation statements that clearly show the journey from problem to solution in a single, powerful sentence.

## When To Use

- Creating social proof that shows dramatic change

- Developing value propositions that show contrast

## Prompt Template

```
Create powerful before-and-after transformation statements from this information:

**CUSTOMER/CLIENT CONTEXT**: [Describe the person/business]
**STARTING SITUATION**: [Where they were before]
**INTERVENTION**: [What you provided/they did]
**END RESULT**: [Where they are now]
**TIMEFRAME**: [How long the transformation took]

Generate 5 different before-and-after statements using these formats:

1. **Problem-to-Solution**: "From [specific problem] to [specific solution] in [timeframe]"
2. **Numbers-Driven**: "Went from [metric] to [metric] in [timeframe]"
3. **Emotional Journey**: "From feeling [emotion] to [emotion] in [timeframe]"
4. **Status Change**: "From [old status] to [new status] in [timeframe]"
5. **Capability Shift**: "From [couldn't do X] to [can now do Y] in [timeframe]"

Guidelines:
- Be specific with numbers, timeframes, and outcomes
- Use concrete, measurable changes when possible
- Keep each statement to one sentence
- Make the contrast dramatic but truthful
- Include the timeframe to add credibility
- Use the customer's actual language when available
- Focus on the most impressive or relevant transformation
