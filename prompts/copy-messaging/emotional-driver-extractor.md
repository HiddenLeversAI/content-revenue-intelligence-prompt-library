# Emotional Driver Extractor

## Purpose
Identify and articulate the deeper emotional motivations behind customer decisions, moving beyond logical benefits to tap into what customers truly feel and fear.

## When To Use
- Your messaging feels too logical and isn't converting
- Need to connect with prospects on an emotional level
- Want to understand the real motivations behind purchases
- Creating more compelling sales and marketing copy
- Developing empathy-driven customer communications

## Prompt Template

```
Extract the emotional drivers from this customer feedback/research:

[PASTE CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS, SURVEYS, OR FEEDBACK HERE]

Analyze for these emotional layers:

**SURFACE EMOTIONS** (What they say they want):
- List the obvious benefits and logical reasons they mention

**DEEPER FEELINGS** (What they really feel):
- What fears are driving this need?
- What frustrations are they experiencing?
- What do they feel inadequate about?
- What are they hoping to feel instead?

**CORE EMOTIONAL DRIVERS** (The real "why"):
- What's the underlying insecurity or desire?
- What identity are they trying to achieve or avoid?
- What social or personal fears are involved?
- What transformation would make them feel complete?

**EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE AUDIT**:
- What specific emotional words do they use?
- What metaphors or imagery appears in their language?
- How do they describe their current state vs. desired state?
- What intensity of emotion comes through?

Create messaging that speaks to each emotional layer:
1. **Empathy Statement**: "I understand you feel..."
2. **Validation**: "It makes sense that you..."
3. **Transformation Promise**: "Imagine feeling... instead"
4. **Identity Bridge**: "You're the type of person who..."
```
