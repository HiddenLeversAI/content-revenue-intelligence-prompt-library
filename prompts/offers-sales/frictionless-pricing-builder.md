I need to create frictionless pricing for my [PRODUCT/SERVICE TYPE].

Offer details:
- What you're selling: [CORE PRODUCT/SERVICE]

- Target customers: [CUSTOMER SEGMENTS]
- Competitive alternatives: [WHAT ELSE THEY MIGHT BUY]

   - Price points that feel natural
   - Value justification for each level

2. **Tier Differentiation**
   - Clear feature/benefit differences
   - Why someone would choose each tier
   - Natural upgrade motivations

3. **Friction Removal Elements**
   - Payment options (one-time vs. installments)
   - Risk reversal (guarantees, trials)
   - Easy decision-making cues

4. **Anchoring Strategy**
   - How to present options
   - Which tier to highlight as "popular"
   - Psychological pricing tactics

5. **Presentation Framework**
   - How to display pricing clearly
   - What to emphasize vs. minimize
   - When to reveal price vs. value

6. **Objection Handling**
