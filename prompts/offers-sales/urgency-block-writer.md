## Prompt

```
I need authentic urgency for my [OFFER TYPE] that encourages action without feeling pushy or fake.

Offer details:
- What you're selling: [PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- Price point: $[AMOUNT]

- Main benefit: [CORE VALUE DELIVERED]
- Typical decision timeline: [HOW LONG THEY USUALLY TAKE]

Context factors:

- Time-limited pricing: [YES/NO - UNTIL WHEN?]
- Seasonal timing: [YES/NO - WHAT SEASON/EVENT?]
- Market window: [YES/NO - WHAT'S CHANGING?]

Please create urgency blocks for:

1. **Market-Based Urgency**
   - Industry trends that make this timely
   - Windows of opportunity

   - Economic factors

2. **Seasonal/Calendar Urgency**
   - Time-of-year relevance
   - Business cycle alignment
   - Planning deadlines
   - Implementation timelines

3. **Scarcity-Based Urgency** (if applicable)
   - Limited availability reasons
   - Capacity constraints
   - Exclusive access elements

4. **Cost-of-Delay Urgency**
   - What happens if they wait
   - Opportunity costs
   - Compounding benefits of starting now
   - Problems that get worse over time

5. **Implementation Urgency**
   - Best time to start for results
   - Learning curve considerations
   - Preparation time needed

For each urgency type, provide:
- 2-3 different messaging approaches
- Varying intensity levels (soft â†’ strong)
- Supporting statistics or examples where relevant
- How to present it authentically

Focus on real, customer-centered reasons rather than artificial deadlines.
