# Objection Collector â†’ Pull sales objections from DMs/calls

## Purpose
Extract and categorize sales objections from client conversations, DMs, and calls to build a comprehensive objection-handling system. Understanding real objections (not theoretical ones) helps create better sales materials and responses.

## Prompt

```
Analyze this client conversation/DM thread/call transcript to identify all sales objections, hesitations, and concerns expressed about working together or making a purchase.

[PASTE CLIENT CONVERSATION/TRANSCRIPT]

For each objection identified, provide:

1. **Objection**: The exact concern expressed (use their words)
2. **Category**: [Price, Time, Authority, Need, Trust, Timing, Fit]
3. **Underlying Fear**: What they're really worried about
4. **Emotional Intensity**: [Low/Medium/High] based on language used
5. **Context**: What triggered this objection
6. **Current Response**: How you handled it (if applicable)
7. **Better Response**: Improved way to address this objection
8. **Prevention**: How to address this before it comes up

Format as:
**OBJECTION #1**
- Stated Concern: "[exact words used]"
- Category: [type of objection]
- Underlying Fear: [what they're really worried about]
- Emotional Intensity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Context: [what prompted this objection]
- Current Response: [how you handled it]
- Better Response: [improved handling approach]
- Prevention: [how to address proactively]

Also provide:
**OBJECTION ANALYSIS**
- Most common objection types
- Highest emotional intensity objections
- Objections you handle well vs. poorly
- Patterns in objection timing
- Recommendations for sales process improvements

Focus on both direct objections ("I can't afford it") and indirect ones ("I need to think about it").
```

## Usage Notes
- Collect objections from discovery calls, sales calls, and follow-up conversations
- Track patterns across different client types and price points
- Use to build FAQ sections, sales pages, and objection-handling scripts
- Reference during sales training or when onboarding team members
- Update responses based on what actually works in real conversations

## Strategic Value
Transforms common sales roadblocks into systematic advantages by understanding and preparing for real objections. This intelligence helps close more deals and creates smoother sales processes based on actual client concerns rather than guessed ones.
