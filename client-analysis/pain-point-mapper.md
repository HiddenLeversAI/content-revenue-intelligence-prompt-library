# Pain Point Mapper â†’ Analyze client calls for recurring problems

## Purpose
Systematically extract and categorize pain points from client conversations to identify patterns, prioritize product development, and create targeted solutions. This analysis reveals what clients struggle with most and helps build a comprehensive problem inventory.

## Prompt

```
Analyze this client conversation/call transcript to map all pain points, challenges, and frustrations mentioned. Create a comprehensive pain point inventory.

[PASTE CLIENT CONVERSATION/TRANSCRIPT]

For each pain point identified, provide:

1. **Pain Point**: Clear description of the problem
2. **Frequency Indicators**: How often this seems to occur ("daily," "constantly," etc.)
3. **Emotional Impact**: Frustration level and emotional language used
4. **Current Solutions**: What they're currently doing (if anything)
5. **Cost of Inaction**: What happens if this isn't solved
6. **Revenue Impact**: How this affects their income/business
7. **Category**: [Operational, Strategic, Technical, Personal, Financial]

Format as:
**PAIN POINT #1**
- Problem: [clear description]
- Frequency: [how often it occurs]
- Emotional Impact: [frustration level/language used]
- Current Solutions: [what they're doing now]
- Cost of Inaction: [consequences of not solving]
- Revenue Impact: [how it affects income]
- Category: [type of pain point]

Also provide:
**PATTERN ANALYSIS**
- Most severe pain points (top 3)
- Most frequent pain points (top 3)
- Highest revenue impact (top 3)
- Gaps in current solutions

Look for both explicitly stated problems and implied frustrations. Pay attention to emotional language, repeated mentions, and time/money costs.
