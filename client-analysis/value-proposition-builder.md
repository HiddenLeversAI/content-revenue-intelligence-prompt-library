# Value Proposition Builder → Draft positioning from consult language

## Purpose
Extract and synthesize value propositions from client consultation language, using their words to understand what they truly value and how they describe ideal outcomes. Build positioning that resonates by using client language patterns.

## Prompt

```
Analyze this client conversation/consultation transcript to extract value proposition elements based on what the client values most and how they describe their ideal outcomes.

[PASTE CLIENT CONVERSATION/TRANSCRIPT]

Extract and organize:

**VALUE DRIVERS** (What they care about most):
- Primary Values: [top 3 things they prioritize]
- Success Metrics: [how they measure success]
- Outcome Language: [exact words they use to describe ideal results]
- Urgency Indicators: [what makes this important now]
- Risk Concerns: [what they're afraid of]

**POSITIONING ELEMENTS**:
- Problem Framing: [how they describe their core challenge]
- Solution Language: [what type of help they're seeking]
- Benefit Priorities: [outcomes they mention most]
- Differentiation Needs: [what they want that's different]
- Proof Requirements: [what evidence they need to believe]

**VALUE PROPOSITION DRAFT**:
Using their language patterns, create:

1. **Primary Value Prop**: One sentence capturing their main desired outcome
2. **Supporting Benefits**: 3-5 key benefits using their words
3. **Proof Points**: Evidence they'd find most compelling
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this unique from their perspective
5. **Call to Action**: Natural next step based on conversation flow

Format as:
**PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION**
"[One compelling sentence using client language]"

**SUPPORTING BENEFITS**
• [Benefit 1 in client language]
• [Benefit 2 in client language]
• [Benefit 3 in client language]

**PROOF REQUIREMENTS**
• [Type of evidence they need]
• [Success stories that would resonate]
• [Metrics that matter to them]

Ensure all language reflects how they think and talk about their situation, not generic marketing speak.
```

## Usage Notes
- Use with multiple client consultations to identify common value patterns
- Test value propositions with other similar prospects to validate resonance
- Update website and sales materials to reflect client-driven language
- Reference when creating case studies that emphasize client-valued outcomes
- Combine insights from multiple clients to build comprehensive positioning

## Strategic Value
Creates value propositions that resonate deeply because they're built from actual client language and priorities rather than assumed benefits. This approach ensures your positioning speaks directly to what your market actually values and cares about.
