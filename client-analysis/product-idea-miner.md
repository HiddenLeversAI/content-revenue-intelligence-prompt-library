2. **Client Need**: The specific problem/gap this would solve
3. **Evidence**: Exact quotes showing demand for this solution
4. **Target Market**: Who else might need this (beyond this client)
5. **Delivery Format**: [Course, Coaching, Template, Software, Service, etc.]
6. **Pricing Tier**: [Low/Mid/High] based on value and complexity
7. **Development Effort**: [Low/Medium/High] to create this offer
8. **Revenue Potential**: Estimated market size and pricing
9. **Validation Needed**: What to test before building

Format as:
**PRODUCT OPPORTUNITY #1**
- Concept: [clear product description]
- Client Need: [specific problem this solves]
- Evidence: "[exact quotes showing demand]"
- Target Market: [who else needs this]
- Delivery Format: [how to deliver this]
- Pricing Tier: [Low/Mid/High]

```

## Usage Notes
- Use with multiple client conversations to identify demand patterns
- Cross-reference ideas with your skills and available time
- Validate concepts with other clients before investing development time
- Consider bundling related ideas into comprehensive offers
- Track which product ideas get repeated across different clients

## Strategic Value
Converts client conversations into a product development pipeline based on real market demand. This approach ensures you build offers that clients actually want and will pay for, rather than products based on assumptions about market needs.
